## Hi there, I am Tiffany ðŸ‘‹

I am a data engineer with an interest in science and data science. I enjoy working in spaces that utilize the intersection of science and technology that strive to advance societies. 

## Most recent projects:

1) A volunteer project to assist African refugees, where I created the data architecture for an fully functional application. <a href="https://github.com/TCarrPGH/deploy-impact-21-kona-a">Dots</a>
2) A data science project that finds the snowline in Swiss hiking trails based on altitude and geographical location. I came up with this project because hiking in the autumn/spring in Switzerland can be difficult, challanging, or dangerous if suddenly, hours into a hike, the trail is covered in snow. On the other hand -- sometimes you may want to find a nice snow covered trail to hike on. <a href="https://github.com/TCarrPGH/bergfex_snow_alert">Bergfex Hiking</a>
